# Game-Cubethon
Its my first game. Made this using Unity, C#.
I tried to copy this game from a famous youtuber named Brackeys.
(His videos are awesome.!!)
So basically in this game you have a cube and it moves.
There are obstacles and if the cube touches those while moving the game will be over
and you have to restart again.
Currently there are just 2 levels in this game and is only playable in windows. (You can try Mac too)
